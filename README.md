# HW3 Starter Code

This repo is set up similarly to your team repo. The backend folder 
contains the express routes, the frontend folder contains the React 
routes, and the common folder contains code used by the frontend and
backend. To start the program select start from the run configurations 
in the top right, then click play. This will install the necessary 
dependencies, then start the backend and frontend.
